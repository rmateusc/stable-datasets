    Every image carries a multi-hot vector over 17 defect codes plus the binary
    ``Defect`` flag, used here as the anomaly label. The official test split is
    **unlabeled** -- its annotation CSV lists filenames only -- so its ``label``,
    ``defects`` and ``water_level`` fields are ``None``.

    .. warning::

       The archives total roughly 340 GB (14 train + 2 val + 2 test, ~19 GB each)
       and the host ignores HTTP ``Range``, so an interrupted archive restarts from
       zero. Splits are fetched one at a time so a finished split's cache is
       committed before the next archive starts. Point ``download_dir=`` and
       ``processed_cache_dir=`` at a volume with room before loading.

    Access requires the share password (no username); a refused download raises
    ``PermissionError`` carrying the setup steps. Images are read straight out of
    the zip archives, so no extracted copy is written to disk.
